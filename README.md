# Image-Classifier-AIND-
In this project, our goal is to develop a deep learning model for classifying different types of flowers based on the provided labels. This project is part of Udacity's coursework and is executed within a GPU-enabled workspace. Please note that the source files for this project are not included in this text-based representation. Our approach involves leveraging transfer learning, specifically utilizing pre-trained classifiers from the PyTorch library, while adapting and customizing the classifier component of each pre-trained model.
